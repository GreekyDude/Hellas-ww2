<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Origins of the Greek Civil War</h2>
<p class="text-lg mb-6">The Greek Civil War emerged from the power vacuum created by the withdrawal of Axis forces in 1944. During the Nazi occupation, various resistance groups had formed, with the communist-led National Liberation Front (EAM) and its military wing, the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), becoming the largest and most effective. As liberation approached, tensions grew between EAM-ELAS and other resistance groups supported by the Greek government-in-exile and the British.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The December Events (Dekemvriana)</h3>
<p class="mb-6">The first major confrontation of the civil war occurred in December 1944, just weeks after German withdrawal. When the government of George Papandreou, backed by British forces, demanded the disarmament of all resistance groups, ELAS refused to surrender their weapons while right-wing militias remained armed. On December 3, 1944, a peaceful EAM demonstration in Athens' Syntagma Square turned violent when police opened fire on the crowd, killing several protesters.</p>
<p class="mb-6">This incident triggered a full-scale battle for Athens between ELAS forces and British-backed government troops. The fighting lasted 33 days and resulted in thousands of casualties before a ceasefire was negotiated in January 1945. The Varkiza Agreement that followed required ELAS to disarm, but many fighters refused, retreating to the mountains to continue resistance.</p>

<p class="text-lg">"In the wake of liberation, Greece was not experiencing peace, but the beginning of a new and more terrible war."</p>
<cite class="text-sm block mt-2">— C.M. Woodhouse, British liaison officer to Greek resistance, 1948</cite>
</blockquote>
<p class="mb-6">The December Events marked a critical turning point, transforming what had been political tensions into armed conflict and setting the stage for the full-scale civil war that would follow.</p>

<p class="mb-6">By 1947, the United States had replaced Britain as the main foreign supporter of the Greek government. The Truman Doctrine, announced in March 1947, pledged American support to "free peoples resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or outside pressures" and was specifically created in response to the situation in Greece. This policy marked the beginning of the American strategy of containment against Soviet influence.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Meanwhile, the communist insurgents received support from the newly established communist regimes in neighboring Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria. However, this support became complicated in 1948 when Yugoslavia under Tito broke with Stalin and the Soviet bloc. The Soviet Union itself provided limited direct aid to the Greek communists, as Greece had been acknowledged as within the Western sphere of influence in the percentages agreement between Stalin and Churchill in 1944.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">The Human Cost and Aftermath</h2>
<p class="text-lg mb-6">The Greek Civil War was one of the most devastating conflicts in modern Greek history, with profound and long-lasting consequences for Greek society and politics.</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Humanitarian Crisis</h3>
<p class="mb-6">The civil war created a massive humanitarian crisis. An estimated 700,000 people were displaced from their homes, with many villages in rural areas completely destroyed. Both sides employed tactics that directly impacted civilians:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
<li>The government implemented a policy of forced evacuation of mountain villages to deny support to the guerrillas</li>
<li>The DSE forcibly recruited fighters, including children who were sent to communist countries for "education"</li>
<li>Thousands of political prisoners were held in detention camps on islands like Makronisos</li>
<li>Food shortages affected much of the population, particularly in rural areas</li>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The End of the Conflict</h3>
<p class="mb-6">By 1949, the tide had turned decisively against the communist forces. The closure of the Yugoslav border following Tito's split with Stalin cut off a crucial supply route and sanctuary for DSE fighters. The Greek National Army, now well-equipped with American supplies and advised by U.S. military personnel, launched a series of major offensives in the summer of 1949.</p>
<p class="mb-6">The final battle took place in the Grammos and Vitsi mountains near the Albanian border in August 1949. After heavy fighting, the remaining DSE forces retreated across the border into Albania. On October 16, 1949, the KKE radio announced a "temporary ceasefire," effectively ending the armed conflict.</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Legacy and Long-term Impact</h3>
